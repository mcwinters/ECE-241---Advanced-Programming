In this project, I built a graph that represents the relationship between Facebook
users. There is an edge between two users if they are friends on Facebook. The weight of the
edge is the closeness of two users, which is defined as the number of communications in each
common post. Using this graph, I connected two unacquainted users with their
friendsâ€™ connections. I also estimated the potential probability of them becoming new
friends through their close friends.
